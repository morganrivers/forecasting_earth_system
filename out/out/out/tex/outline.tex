\subsection*{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Historical context of predicting effects of interventions in \ABSTRACT. \citewithtitle{dellavignaPredictScienceImprove2019} \citewithtitle{HowCanYou}
  \ifsus{ The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model \citewithtitle{MITEmissionsPrediction}}

  \item Brief survey of existing works which attempt to forecast real-world outcomes with language models:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Existing domains where LLM's are used to forecast
      \ifsus{\item Large language models can  serve as data sources for policy deliberation and multi‑criteria assessment of climate and sustainability interventions \citewithtitle{binaLargeLanguageModels2025}}
      \item General skill level of forecasts in real-world domains
      \item Relevant techniques used for LLM forecasting (briefly)
      % Recent literature explores how well language models perform on forecasting tasks across many domains.
      \item Evidence from retail and economics suggests that LLM forecasters do not always outperform human experts or simple statistical models
      \citewithtitle{abolghasemiHumansVsLarge2025}\citewithtitle{schoeneggerLargeLanguageModel2023}\citewithtitle{luEvaluatingLLMsRealWorld2025}
      \item LLMs can accurately simulate and predict the outcomes of social science and field experiments
      \citewithtitle{hewittPredictingResultsSocial}\citewithtitle{chenPredictingFieldExperiments2025}
      \item Retrieval‑augmented and ensemble‑based systems are approaching or surpassing human‑level forecasting 
      \citewithtitle{halawiApproachingHumanLevelForecasting2024}\citewithtitle{WisdomSiliconCrowd} \citewithtitle{abolghasemiHumansVsLarge2025} \citewithtitle{yanq.serajr.hej.mengl.andsylvaint.AutoCastEnhancingWorld2024}

\subsection*{Prediction Markets and Superforecasting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Strategies for forecasting on geopolitical and economic questions \citewithtitle{tetlockSuperforecastingArtScience2015}
  \item The rise of prediction markets \citewithtitle{hansonShallWeVote2013} For example, ``racetrack market odds improve on the prediction of racetrack  experts; orange juice commodity futures improve on government weather forecasts;  stocks fingered the guilty firm in the Challenger crash long before the official NASA  panel; Oscar markets beat columnist forecasts; gas demand markets beat gas  demand experts; betting markets beat Hewlett Packard official printer sale  forecasts; and betting markets beat Eli Lily official drug trial forecasts.''
  \item Superforecasting tournaments \citewithtitle{mellersIdentifyingCultivatingSuperforecasters2015}
  \item Efficacy and cost of forecasting \INTERVENTION\ outcomes \citewithtitle{EvaluatingGermanDevelopment}
  \item AI assistance can augment human forecasters, while prompt engineering on its own offers limited gains \citewithtitle{schoeneggerAIAugmentedPredictionsLLM2025}\citewithtitle{schoeneggerPromptEngineeringLarge2025}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods for LLM Forecasting}
\subsection*{Data Sources}
\begin{itemize}
\item MAYBE Ex-ante predictions
\begin{itemize}
\item MAYBE Registered studies
\end{itemize}

\ifdev{\item UN pre-evaluations (NOTE: Need to double check name)}
\ifdev{\item Looking at distributions of outcomes (whether went well or not)}
\ifdev{\item What sort of interventions and indicators do we have for the data we use (And specifically for BMZ)}
\ifdev{\item Note that: link in tex has all the data for thousands of entries}%https://github.com/datenlabor-bmz/awesome-development-cooperation-data }
\ifdev{\item BMZ    Transparenzportal: unified with metadata \citewithtitle{EvaluatingGermanDevelopment}}
\ifdev{\item KfW    Interactive Database for Evaluation and Learning: lots of entries (1200) and full evaluations. However, no ex-ante predictions as far as we could find. Has API that can get the 6 categories. Effickivitat and Wirkungen and Nachhaltigkeit are good to predict. He thinks it would be very valuable to predict on the KfW data in particular (given that it's more rigorous and standardized. Developer tools -> network -> response and headers). KfW is a contractor/part of BMZ. So helps a lot to have predictions for these! SEE TEX FOR LINK} %https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/ideal/
\ifdev{\item KfW  Has impact evaluation lab (2 individuals to talk to). Can tell me what would be useful for them.}
\ifdev{\item GIZ    Medien- und Informationszentrum: website with pdfs. 1300 evaluations. Same 6 categories as KfW. more messy. KfW is more rigorous in general. However, don't have API so would need LLM to extract (don't start with this)}
\ifdev{\item They do have reports published before starts. However, very few of them also have published evaluation results (the predictions are usually from recent years unfortunately).}
\ifdev{\item In most cases, KfW and GIZ have "goals", but these are not that useful.}
\ifdev{\item IATI: look into it briefly to see if can get anything of interest there (SEE TEX)}%https://d-portal.org/

\subsection*{Selecting LLM's for Forecasting \DOMAINCAPITALIZEDINTERVENTIONTWO }

  \begin{itemize}
  \item How does base model skill affect forecasting performance
  \end{itemize}
  \item The base models that were selected (Llama 70B, ChatGPT 3.5). \citewithtitle{touvronLlama2Open2023}
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Baseline Measures to Compare Against LLM Forecasts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Existing ex-ante predictions NOTE: Not actually as useful, maybe deprioritize unless find something
  \item Simple statistical models (most common answer, outcome of most similar abstract)
  \item MAYBE REMOVE OR KEEP AS FALLBACK Random forest model for categorical outcomes

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grading Forecast Accuracy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choosing categories for \DOMAIN\ outcomes
  \item Training set, validation set, test set
  \item Required number of test set abstracts as a function of required confidence level of forecasting skill
  \item k-fold cross-validation (try looking at the projects from BMZ), we want to collect this data and compare to BMZ accuracy specifically
  \citewithtitle{ElementsStatisticalLearning}
  \item  Forecast accuracy evaluation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Categorical: Statistical Accuracy, Brier Score, RMSE, f1
    \item Qualitative: o4-mini similarity grading
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use strictly proper scoring rules, such as the logarithmic, Brier and continuous ranked probability scores, to encourage honest probabilistic forecasts and sharp predictive distributions \citewithtitle{gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007}
\end{itemize}
\ifdev{ \subsection*{NOTE: YES THEY REALLY WANT THIS: Predicting the Confidence of a Forecast}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Training a classifier on model performance to predict how ``forecastable'' the intervention is
      \item the name for this is ``''
    \end{itemize} }
