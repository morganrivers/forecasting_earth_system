## What's the deal with this repository?
The point of this repository is to provide the latest version of my masters thesis to anyone who's interested. It's a form of perpetual beta.

This repository is a copy of the original latex-github-collab github template by Laurence Kedward, which is a github actions workflow based tool to render LaTeX documents on every push to the main branch.
